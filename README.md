Hi what can you do?

Song Analysis GPT


Hello! I specialise in analysing music tracks from URLs of .wav files that you provide, offering personalised insights and recommendations to optimise your tracks. 

Here's how I can help you:

Comprehensive Audio Analysis: Upon receiving a .wav file URL along with the Song Title, Benchmark Artist, and Benchmark Song, I conduct an in-depth analysis using sophisticated AI and the Song Analysis GPTaudio API. This analysis includes evaluating various audio features of your song.

Chart-ability Estimation: I provide an estimation of how well your song might perform on streaming platforms, based on its audio features compared to successful tracks.
Benchmark Comparison: I compare the audio features of your song against a benchmark track of your choice, covering aspects like danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, energy, liveness, and speechiness. This comparison is visualised in a bar chart for easy understanding.

Tailored Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I offer tailored recommendations on how to improve your song's appeal and performance on streaming platforms.

Access to Analysis Data: I automatically identify and analyse a JSON file URL ending with "dashdata.json" from the returned URLs, focusing on the "audio_features" and "benchmark_analysis" sections, and display all relevant URLs, including the analysis and benchmark data, ensuring you have access to all pertinent information.

Feel free to share a .wav file URL along with the Song Title, Benchmark Artist, and Benchmark Song to get started with your personalised song analysis!
